# Educake App
The continuation after the "just a class project", now more integrated, surrounding Web, Desktop and Mobile

### FrontEnd Libraries
| Name          | Grade   | Notes |
|---------------|---------|-------|
|    React.js   | ◆◆◇◇◇ | A bit popular, but with a lot of thing we will probably not use |
|    Ember.js   | ◆◆◆◆◇ | Same as react (but not so much popular), simpler one, but almost the same learning curve |
|    Angular.js | ◆◆◆◇◇ | Another popular one, but as the up ones, a little complicated to be used in this project |
| ⭐️ Vue.js     | ◆◆◆◆◆ | Similar and a lot simpler than Angular |

### UIKits
| Name          | Grade   | Notes |
|---------------|---------|-------|
| ⭐️ Siimple\*    | ◆◆◆◆◆ | Simple and readable, columns similar to bootstrap, lack some components to minimize size |
|    Skeleton    | ◆◆◆◇◇ | As the Siimple, but isn't responsible/flexible  |
|    Milligram   | ◆◆◆◆◇ | Simple, readable, Mobile first, but they have problems with table resizing and don't wrap the text on columns |
* Siimple: It'll get a new version early.


### What need to be learned:
1. Javascript... yeah, fuck the frontend library at the start, all the ones are made with Javascript, and we don't have to be tool dependent, think about the future, maybe you receive a opportunity to work in a web frontend development, what will you need to know, Angular? React? Vue? No. And if those tools got deprecated? What will you do?.
2. Know and how I say it... "Na ponta da língua" the meaning of these words/acronyms:
  - Document Object Model (DOM) and what is it's nodes;
  - WebComponents;
  - Routes and Stores;
  - Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM);
3. Module Bundlers like WebPack and Browserify;
4. File watchers (or preprocessors) like Sass, LESS, Haml (OPTIONAL);
